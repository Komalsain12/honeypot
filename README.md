# Project Honeypot - Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking

## Introduction

Welcome to Project Honeypot, a cybersecurity initiative dedicated to detecting and tracking malicious activity on the internet. This project is a collaborative effort in the realm of ethical hacking, aiming to enhance online security by identifying and understanding cyber threats.

## What is Project Honeypot?

Project Honeypot serves as a network of honeypotsâ€”trap systems designed to lure and detect cyber attackers. By analyzing the behavior of malicious entities, we gather valuable data that helps cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers stay one step ahead of potential threats.

## Key Objectives

- **Detection and Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and detect malicious activities within the online environment.
- **Data Collection:** Gather data on tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by cyber attackers.
- **Information Sharing:** Share insights and threat intelligence with the cybersecurity community to strengthen overall defense mechanisms.

## How It Works

1. **Honeypot Deployment:** Various honeypots are strategically deployed across the internet, mimicking vulnerable systems and services.
2. **Trap and Analyze:** Malicious actors unknowingly interact with these honeypots, triggering alerts and capturing valuable information about their methods.
3. **Threat Intelligence:** Collected data is transformed into actionable threat intelligence, contributing to a better understanding of cyber threats.
